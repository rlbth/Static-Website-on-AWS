# Static-Website-on-AWS

The cloud is perfect for hosting static websites that only include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that require no server-side processing. The projects' aim is to deploy a static website on AWS.

1.Creating an S3 bucket, configuring the bucket for website hosting, and securing it using IAM policies.

2.Uploading the website files to the s3 bucket created and speeding up content delivery using AWSâ€™s content distribution network service, CloudFront.

3.Accessing the website in a browser using the unique S3 endpoint.
